# CoffeeMakerClone
Authorized Coffee Maker Clone Created by Joshua Allen and Adam Fleichhacker

In order to run the tests:

Use this command to compile:
javac -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar CoffeeTest.java

Use this test to run:
java -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CoffeeTest

If you want to run the actual CoffeMaker game, I would go into the CoffeeMaker.java file, right click inside of it, and select run this file.

Equivalence classes are in the comments of the CoffeeTest.java file.
